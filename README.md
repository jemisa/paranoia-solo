# A day at the Alfa Complex

***This is the Alpha Complex. A futuristic metropolis controlled by a mad computer that behaves like a fascist tyrant.  Totally paranoid, the Computer sees traitors everywhere and sees to the happiness of its citizens - even if it has to kill them all! Are you a happy citizen? No! ZIOUF! You've been disintegrated, a clone is coming to replace you...***

The Alpha Complex is completely enclosed, with no outdoor areas. A vast maze of colored corridors. People are classified by colors that determine their security levels, according to the Computer's criteria. Disobeying a citizen with a higher Security Level than yours is treason. Being a communist is treason (although you have no idea what a communist is). Belonging to a secret society is treason. Treason is punishable by death.

The computer has prepared this solo adventure to entertain you, the citizen. Make your decisions and follow the instructions. Failure to follow the instructions is treason. Treason is punishable by death.

Have a nice adventure, citizen.
