You are JOCA CAB-1, an infrared citizen, the lowest social class in the Alpha Complex. You work in R&D (Research and Development), the division of the Complex that creates new inventions to make everyone happy. Remember, happiness is mandatory. Anyone who isn't happy is a traitor. Are you happy, citizen?

Your job in R&D is simple: do slave labor for the scientists and serve as a guinea pig for their experiments, which usually explode in your face. How happy are you, citizen?

Today, arriving at the workplace, you receive a black envelope from your boss ZECA-G-JUM 2 (the only color you can handle - for citizens of Infrared Level, touching an object of any other color is treason). ZECA tells you that he has lost an ALF key and you should go and get another one for him from Production, Logistics and Commissariat.
